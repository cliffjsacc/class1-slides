1. Number of Hours: 39 hours (4/2/2020 - 5/19/2020)

    Tues, Thurs @ 06:00 PM - 09:00 PM
    
    Instructor Lead Online Lecture & Lab

2. Course Description:

    Utilizing Python 3, Intermediate Python is a project-based class in which you will learn the ins and 
    outs of the Python language beginning where the introduction class left off. This class takes a new 
    approach to learning python and integrates with many of the same technologies you would see working 
    in the development world such as GitHub and cloud IDEs. This course will give you the tools and 
    experience you need to apply the Python programming language in real world scenarios upon completion.

3. Required Text Book:
- Think Python 2e: How to Think Like a Computer Scientist - 2nd Edition, Allen Downey.
  Available for free via a PDF [eBook](http://greenteapress.com/thinkpython2/thinkpython2.pdf) or 
  HTML [online](http://greenteapress.com/thinkpython2/html/index.html).

4. Prerequisites:
  - ITSE-2079 Introduction to Python course, or novice knowledge of Python and OOP languages
  - Understanding of variables, data types, and basic function usage in Python 3

    These prerequisites are more of a guideline as opposed to a hard requirement. You can still take the class
    without them, but it could prove to be more difficult. The first couple of classes will be a high level
    overview of Chapters 1-8 of Think Python 2nd Edition. We will be completing the exercises in class as a refresher.

6. Evaluation:
Students who participate in class discussions, demonstrate completion of class assignments and two
projects, and miss no more than three unexcused class meetings, can earn continuing education units.
Excused absences require notification to the instructor before the class session, with a justified 
reason for absence. Grading criteria for Pass-Fail (P-F), or for a letter grade (A, B, C, D, F) 
if required by the student, are described below:

  Grade  |   Grade Criteria             |         Comments
  ------ |   -------------------------  |  ---------------------------------------------------------
  20%    |  Participation / Attendance  |  Active student participation and attendance  
  40%    |  Labs / Assignments          |  Completion of all course exercises  
  40%    |  2 Projects                  |  Presentation and demonstration of 2 personal projects

>Note: P-F students may work in small project groups by instructor approval, but individual projects are encouraged.
